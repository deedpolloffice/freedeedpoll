The licences in this directory are included with FREE DEED POLL.org because FREE
DEED POLL.org includes other works which are licensed under open-source
licences. The terms of some of those licences require that a copy of that
licence is included with any new work that includes or derives from the licensed
work. The licences in this directory are therefore here in order to fulfil the
terms of those works included within FREE DEED POLL.org.

The presence of any licence in this directory should not be interpreted to mean
that this work (i.e. FREE DEED POLL.org) is licensed under that licence. FREE
DEED POLL.org is licensed only under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public
License version 3.
